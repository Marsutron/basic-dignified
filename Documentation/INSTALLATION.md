# Installation    ### Requirements  To run Basic Dignified you will need:  - **Python 3.10+**    You can use any **text editor** to write Dignified code and convert it with **Basic Dignified** on the **command line**, but to get the most of the **experience** with a **build system**, **syntax highlight** and **more**, you will need to have **installed**:  - **Sublime Text 3 or 4** with Package Control.  - **openMSX** with an emulated disk drive.    ### The basic setup    **Download** this repository by clicking on the green `<> Code` button on the **main page** and selecting **Download ZIP** at the bottom. **Unzip** the downloaded file on the **appropriated** folder of your choice and rename it to whatever you want. For the purpose of this manual, lets rename it to `BasicDignified`.  If all you want is the **conversion** through the **command line**, you are set. See the Basic Dignified [manual](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/Documentation/BASIC_DIGNIFIED.md) on how to use it.    ### The main programs    The main **converter** is in the root folder, it's called `badig.py`.  The **tokenizer** and **DignifieR** are in `\BasicDignified\Modules\msx\`.  To run the **tokenizer** from the **root** folder or to use it as an **standalone** program see it's [manual](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/Documentation/TOKENIZER.md).    ### The Sublime Tools (MSX)    Preparing **Sublime Text**:    Make sure **Package Control** is installed on Sublime Text.    Enter the path to the **current** location of `\BasicDignified\sublimebuild.py` on the files:  `MSX Basic.sublime-build`  `MSX Basic Dignified.sublime-build`  They are on the folder `\BasicDignified\Sublime Tools\MSX\`    Change `PATH_TO/BasicDignified/sublimebuild.py` to your path on **every** line like:  `"cmd": ["python", "-u", "PATH_TO/BasicDignified/sublimebuild.py", "$file", `...    >Note that on your system, `python` **could** be `python3`.  >Windows users must use `/` or `\\` instead of the traditional `\`    To **install** the files Sublime needs to **configure** the Dignified **environment**:  Open **Sublime Text** and select the menu **Preferences > Browse Packages** to open the Sublime **Packages** folder.  Move the **contents** of `\Sublime Tools\` inside the `User` folder on the Sublime **packages** folder    >The Sublime Package folder is usually on:  **Windows**: `C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages\`.  **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`  **Linux**: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/`    If using **openMSX** to run the build, enter its path on the file:  `sublimebuild.ini`  On the folder `\BasicDignified\Modules\Settings\`    On one of the following lines **according** to your system:  `emulator_filepath = [/PATH_TO/openmsx|openmsx.exe|openmsx.app]`  **Windows**: `[WINDOWS]`  **macOS**: `[DARWIN]`  **Linux**: `[LINUX]`    The **first time** you open a basic program, **classic** or **Dignified** in Sublime, you may need to **chose** the appropriated **highlight** on the **bottom right** of Sublime Text inside **User >**.    ### Cleanup    You can safely delete the folders:  `Sublime Tools` (after moving its contents to Sublime's packages folder)  `Images` (Contains images for the GitHub page)  `Examples` (Contains a Basic program in Dignified and classic formats)  `Documentation` (Contains the instruction manuals)
