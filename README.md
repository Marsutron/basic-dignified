# Basic Dignified Suite  
**v2.0**  
  
> I think this might have come out of beta. Not really sure.   
  
> The **2.0 version** of the Basic Dignified Suite is slightly **incompatible** with the **previous versions** so old Dignified code must be **updated** accordingly. A list of incompatibilities is available on a link below.  
  
**Basic Dignified** is a suite of tools aimed to facilitate the creation, writing and maintaining of classical Basic programs, especially the ones from computers of the **8-bit** era. Basic Dignified has a **modular** approach that makes it **easy** to **create** modules for any **dialect** of classical Basic as well as **tools** to assist the **production** and **execution** of the programs.  
  
**Basic Dignified** is itself a 'dialect' of the classical Basics, adding **modern** coding style and standards that can be composed on any text editor and **converted** to traditional Basic to be executed.  
  
**Basic Dignified** code strives to be as **similar** as the original Basics as possible, keeping the language essentially the **same**. The only necessary feature are the **labels** that replace number lines, all other components can be learned **gradually** making for a very gentle learning curve.  
  
Dignified Basic is written **without line numbers**, can be **indented**  and have **lines broken**, can use variables with **long names**, have macros **defined** and external files **included**, has a kind of **function** construct, can use **Unicode** special characters analogues to the original character set, as well as **rem toggles** (directives to control the suite), **true** and **false** statements, **compound arithmetic** operators and much more.  The conversion is customizable with controls for **line numbers**, **spaces**, **code cleanup** and more.  
  
The suite is designed to be very **modular**, implementing any **flavor** of Basic through modules that describe their **unique** characteristics. The **modules** are programmed **independently** and loaded as needed.  

**External** tools like **tokenizers** and **emulators** to run and debug the code can be **easily** added through **individual** modules inside each system ecosystem.  
  
The module and tools can add their own **commands** and **directives** to the overall control of Basic Dignified.

The suite can be used directly from the terminal, through command line arguments, but it is best experienced inside  **IDEs** and code editors like **Sublime Text**, **VSCode** and others.  

By default, the suite comes with two modules, one for **MSX Basic** and one for **Color Computer Basic** and **YOU** can make the next module. **ZX Spectrum** or **Commodore 64**, anyone?  
  
The included modules contains the **Basic language description**, control for included **tokenizers**, the ability run the code on **emulators** and support for the **Sublime Text** editor with **build system**, **syntax highlight** for the **Dignified** and **Classic** Basic versions as well as **themes**, **snippets**, **completions** and more.

>**Beyond** the Dignified code, Basic Dignified can open **classic** ASCII code to **tokenize**, **execute**, **monitor** and more.  

>On **openMSX** on the **Mac** or **Linux**, the code can be **monitored** during execution and errors are **reported** back to the correct line in the Dignified code.  

> On **MSX**, to help **kickstart** you on the **Dignified** thing, try **MSX Basic DignifieR** to **convert** a **classic** Basic to the **Dignified** format.
