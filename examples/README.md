# Examples  
  
## MSX  

### Change Graph Kit  
A MSX program written with Basic Dignified and converted to classic MSX Basic.  
Change Graph Kit is an utility to find and modify uncompressed game graphics straight from a disk.  
  
**Dignified version**  
  [`CGK173.dmx`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/msx/CGK173.dmx)  
An MSX Basic program written the Dignified way.  
  
**Classic version**  
  [`CGK173.amx`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/msx/CGK173.amx)  
The classic ASCII code converted from the Dignified version.  
  
  **Binary version**  
  [`CGK173.bmx`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/msx/CGK173.bmx)  
The classic binary code converted with the tokenizer.  
  
**List file**  
[`CGK173.lmx`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/msx/CGK173.lmx)  
The list file generated by the tokenizer.  
  
> `CGKConf.cfg` and `CGKTools.com` are support files for Change Graph Kit.  
> `PETILSTG.BIN` is an example file to test Change Graph Kit and came from the game **[PetitLuster in G](http://blog.livedoor.jp/cobinee/archives/1866846.html)** from [Dwarf Play](http://blog.livedoor.jp/cobinee/).  

## CoCo

### Example  
A CoCo program written with Basic Dignified and converted to classic CoCo Basic.  
This program is just an excuse to test Basic Dignified (and the `GET` `PUT` instructions on the CoCo).  
  
**Dignified version**  
  [`EXAMPLE.DCC`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/coco/EXAMPLE.DCC)  
An CoCo Basic program written the Dignified way.  

**Classic version**  
  [`EXAMPLE.ACC`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/coco/EXAMPLE.ACC)  
The classic ASCII code converted from the Dignified version.  
  
  **Binary version**  
  [`EXAMPLE.BCC`](https://github.com/farique1/basic-dignified/blob/main/examples/coco/EXAMPLE.BCC)
